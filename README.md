# StackOverflow Twilio PHP Examples

This project contains a number of examples of working with the Twilio API using [Twilio's PHP helper library](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/php).

The intention is to provide more examples of working with the library and Twilio's respective APIs than the documentation currently does, or likely could. 
This is not to decry the documentation. 
I love it and use it almost daily.
However, it can only provide so many examples and cover so many use cases. 
There's no point in attempting to be everything to everyone.

This project attempts to augment it, where it makes sense to do so, and cover use cases that have been asked for (indirectly or directly) on StackOverflow in [the Twilio Collective](https://stackoverflow.com/collectives/twilio).
